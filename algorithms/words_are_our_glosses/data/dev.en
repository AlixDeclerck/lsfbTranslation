This morning, we expect rain at times heavy in the center and east of the country, while in the west it will be drier. In the afternoon, the disturbance will gradually move towards Germany. At the back, the weather will become variable with some showers, possibly accompanied by thunder in the west. Cloudiness will remain abundant, but in the west a few breaks will be possible this afternoon. Highs of between 9 and 12 degrees will be reached in the morning. In the afternoon, temperatures will be around 10 degrees in the center. The wind will often be moderate from the southwest, later turning to the west at the coast.
In the evening, the risk of showers will diminish while clear skies will develop north of the Sambre et Meuse trench. Tonight, the weather will remain dry with alternating clear and cloudy spells. In the Ardennes, fields of low clouds will form and may locally limit visibility. The minimum temperatures will be between 2 and 6 degrees. The wind will generally be moderate from the southwest, veering back to the south.
Very mild maritime air from the southwest is circulating over our regions between a high-pressure area over Italy and a low-pressure area over the North Sea. An undulating front, linked to the low-pressure area, will first influence our weather. Then the air mass will become temporarily unstable. Tonight and the following night, a weak ridge of high pressure will stabilize the atmosphere.
